Comparision of Ant Colony and Dijkstra's pathing Algorithm in terms of virus spread implemented in java.

Instructions to run demo:
- run the GenerateCity.java, which takes in two arguments for number of cities and city size, to generate a map to tranverse.
- run the TestData.java, which takes in up to three arguments for number of ants, number of iterations, and an optional argument (-d) to run dijkstra's algorithm, which will return output files for Ant Colony Algorithm or Dijkstra's Algorithm

(Optional) to benchmark Algorithms:
- the Main.java file can be ran from the console and give feedback on time
